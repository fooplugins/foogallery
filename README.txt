**Gutenberg**

We love the new Gutenberg editor. We have built a really simple-to-use Gutenberg block to add your existing FooGalleries in seconds. And it includes live previews of the gallery too! Also works in WP5 beta!

**GDPR**

When you install FooGallery for the first time, the plugin asks you (the website admin) to opt-in so that we can track your usage of the plugin and provide a better service (send you update emails for new version releases and security updates etc). *This is optional and not required in order to use the plugin.*

From your website point of view, FooGallery never collects or stores any visitor information at all, when someone visits your website.

**PHP 7 Compatible**

FooGallery has been tried and tested on servers running PHP 7.

**Retina Support**

FooGallery now comes with built-in support for higher quality thumbnails on retina-enabled displays. No more blurry thumbnails, just crisp thumbnails that look amazing on all devices.

**Video Support**

FooGallery PRO now supports the creation of video galleries! Import from YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, TED and Dailymotion, or use a self-hosted video from any online source. You can also easily create mixed galleries with both images and videos!

**Albums Built In**

Albums are now built in as an extension. Simply head over to the extensions page and activate the albums extension. A new menu item will appear that allows you to add albums just as easily as galleries.

**Built For Developers**

FooGallery was designed to be the most developer-friendly gallery plugin available for WordPress. It was also built on top of a solid extension framework, which means different functionality is separated out into different areas in the codebase. It also means the core plugin is lightweight, but still allowing for the most flexibility.

**Contribute**

FooGallery is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/fooplugins/foogallery).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `foogallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
