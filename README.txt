**Test Drive**

[Start FooGallery Test Drive!](https://app.instawp.io/launch?t=foogallery-free&d=v2)

**Documentation**

*	[FooGallery Documentation](https://fooplugins.com/documentation/foogallery/)

**Gutenberg**

FooGallery includes a really simple-to-use Gutenberg block to add your existing FooGallery image galleries in seconds. And it includes live previews of the image gallery too!

**GDPR**

When you install FooGallery for the first time, the plugin asks you (the website admin) to opt-in so that we can track your usage of the plugin and provide a better service (send you update emails for new version releases and security updates etc). *This is optional and not required in order to use the plugin.*

From your website point of view, FooGallery never collects or stores any visitor information at all, when someone visits your website.

**PHP 8 Compatible**

FooGallery has been tried and tested on servers running up to PHP 8

**Retina Support**

FooGallery is a responsive gallery with built-in support for higher quality thumbnails on retina-enabled displays. No more blurry thumbnails, just crisp thumbnails so that your image galleries look amazing on all devices.

**Video Gallery**

FooGallery PRO Expert allows you to create a video gallery in seconds! Import from YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, TED and Dailymotion, or import a self-hosted video from any online source (eg. S3 bucket).
You can also easily create mixed galleries with both images and videos!

**WooCommerce**

Sell your photographs online with our full WooCommerce integration, available in PRO Commerce. You can either create a dynamic gallery from your existing products, or you can sell images in a gallery by linking them to a single master product. With full support for variations. Highlight products for sale with ribbons. Add call-to-action buttons to your images, for example Add to Cart buttons.

**Albums Built In**

Albums are built in as an feature. Simply head over to the Features page and activate the albums feature. A new menu item will appear that allows you to add albums just as easily as galleries.

**Built For Developers**

FooGallery was designed to be the most developer-friendly image gallery plugin available for WordPress. It was also built on top of a solid extension framework, which means different functionality is separated out into different areas in the codebase. It also means the core plugin is lightweight, but still allowing for the most flexibility.

**Special Thanks**

Thanks to Fortinet FortiGuard Labs for the security testing conducted on the plugin. FooGallery is a safer plugin thanks to them.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `foogallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You will be redirected to the FooGallery Help page to get started with the best gallery plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My galleries are not working. Thumbnails are greyed out and not loading when I scroll down the page. =

Lazy loading is not working on your gallery. This could be due to a conflict between our plugin and your theme.
You can test this theory by testing a different theme (if possible).
We can help you get it working, by contacting our support.

= I have created a gallery in the backend, but when I look at it on the frontend, it does not show correctly. =

Sometimes, there are issues when the theme does not follow WordPress best practices.
In order for FooGallery to function properly, the theme needs to have:
    * A call to wp_head(); in the header.php file.
    * A call to wp_footer(); in the footer.php file.

One way to check if the theme is the problem, is by switching to one of the built-in WordPress themes, and then see if the gallery loads.

= After updating, my galleries no longer work! What should I do? =

Do you have any WordPress caching or optimization plugins? If so, then clear/purge your caches.
Do you have any caching setup at your website host? If so, clear/purge those caches.

= After installing the plugin, my site is broken! Help! =

First thing to do is restore your site to it's previous working state.
1. Get access to your site via FTP, or SFTP.
2. Navigate to the wp-content/plugins folder.
3. Rename the foogallery folder to foogallery1 in order to deactivate the plugin.
4. At this point, your site should be working again.
5. Please contact our support and provide the following info:
    * What version of WordPress you are running.
    * What version of PHP you are using.
    * What version of FooGallery you installed.
    * What error was shown when your site was broken?
    * What plugins and theme are you using?

= Is FooGallery The Best Wordpress Gallery Plugin? =

We certainly think so, but do not take our word for it. We did the research. FooGallery has the best performance and has the most features out of any free WordPress gallery plugin. Read our blog post about it:

[What is the Best WordPress Gallery Plugin?](https://fooplugins.com/best-wordpress-gallery-plugin/)

= Do you care for Google's Core Web Vitals? =

A faster gallery now means a more favourable ranking in Google!
FooGallery has been specifically optimized to score better for Google's Core Web Vitals update in 2021.
We have focused on the speed of our javascript code, and also improved the visual stability of all gallery layouts.
This has led to dramatically better scores for the 3 key lighthouse factors including:

*   Largest Contentful Paint - galleries load and appear quicker for your visitors
*   First Input Delay - you can interact with the gallery sooner
*   Cumulative Layout Shift - gallery images shift around a lot less than before!

= I purchased a PRO license, but the Free version is still running. =

Make sure you are running the PRO version. You can check this by visiting the FooGallery -> Account page within the WordPress admin.
If you do not have the PRO version, you can download it by visiting your account page at https://fooplugins.com/account
If you have the PRO version, then clear any caches on your site or for your host. Also clear CSS Optimiztion Cache from FooGallery Settings.
If it still does not work, then please contact our support to help further.

= Why are my thumbnails so blurry? =

Have you enabled retina support for your galleries? To enable retina support, edit the gallery and locate the Retina Support metabox.

= Can I add videos to my galleries? =

Yes, video is supported in [FooGallery PRO Expert](https://fooplugins.com/foogallery-wordpress-gallery-plugin/#pro-expert-features)!

= Can I sell my photography online with this plugin? =

Yes, that is why we built [FooGallery PRO Commerce](https://fooplugins.com/foogallery-wordpress-gallery-plugin/#pro-commerce-features)!
You can choose to create a gallery based off your existing WooCommerce products, or you can link all images in a gallery to a master product. This allows you complete control over how you want to run your image store and how they are sold on your website.

= Do I need to install a separate plugin to show a lightbox? =

No, we have built in a uniquely beautiful lightbox!

= How do I import galleries from another install? =

Simply go to the FooGallery Features page and activate the Import/Export feature on your source installation and your destination installation.
Login into your source WordPress install, and click on the FooGallery -> Import/Export menu item.
Click the Export tab and select the galleries you want to export and click Export.
Copy the export data that is generated.
Login into your destination WordPress install, and click on the FooGallery -> Import/Export menu item.
Paste the export data and click Import.
Please note : the images in your source install need to be accessible to your destination install (this means you cannot lock down your source install if you want this to work).

= How do I get albums working? =

Simply go to the FooGallery Features page and activate the Albums feature.

= Can I add a watermark to my images? =

Yes, our PRO Commerce plan includes image watermarking.

= Can I add external links to items in the gallery? =

Yes, you can link to any external website by choosing "Custom URL" for the Thumbnail Link setting. You also then need to set a custom URL for the items in your gallery, which is done by editing the attachment.

= How do I turn off all the PRO Promotions in the admin? =

Goto FooGallery Settings -> Advanced Tab and check "Disable PRO Promotions" and then save your settings.
