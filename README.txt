== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is FooGallery The Best Wordpress Gallery Plugin? =

FooGallery has been optimized for performance and has a ton of features in the free version. Read our blog post where we compare FooGallery to other WordPress gallery plugins:

[Best WordPress Gallery Plugins Compared](https://fooplugins.com/best-wordpress-gallery-plugin/)

= Can I add videos to my galleries? =

Yes, video galleries are supported in [FooGallery PRO Expert](https://fooplugins.com/foogallery-wordpress-gallery-plugin/pro-expert). You can import from YouTube, Vimeo or use self-hosted videos.

= Can I sell my photography online? =

Yes, that is why we built [FooGallery PRO Commerce](https://fooplugins.com/foogallery-wordpress-gallery-plugin/pro-commerce-features) - it integrates deeply with WooCommerce.
You can choose to create a gallery based off your existing WooCommerce products, or you can link all images in a gallery to a master product. Sell with variations and allow image file downloads.

= My galleries are not working. Thumbnails are greyed out and not loading when I scroll down the page. =

Lazy loading is not working on your gallery. This could be due to a conflict between our plugin and your theme.
You can test this theory by testing a different theme (if possible).
We can help you get it working, by contacting our support.

= I have created a gallery in the backend, but when I look at it on the frontend, it does not show correctly. =

Sometimes, there are issues when the theme does not follow WordPress best practices.
In order for FooGallery to function properly, the theme needs to have:
    * A call to wp_head(); in the header.php file.
    * A call to wp_footer(); in the footer.php file.

One way to check if the theme is the problem, is by switching to one of the built-in WordPress themes, and then see if the gallery loads.

= I am getting a 503 server error whenever I try to edit galleries from the admin =

Some versions of PHP have issues with the Imagick Image library, which FooGallery uses to generate thumbnails.
To fix this problem, goto FooGallery Settings -> Images, and ensure "Force GD Library" is checked and save settings.
This will force your server to rather use the GD image library to avoid the 503 errors.

= After updating, my galleries no longer work! What should I do? =

Do you have any WordPress caching or optimization plugins? If so, then clear/purge your caches.
Do you have any caching setup at your website host? If so, clear/purge those caches.

= After installing the plugin, my site is broken! Help! =

First thing to do is restore your site to it's previous working state.
1. Get access to your site via FTP, or SFTP.
2. Navigate to the wp-content/plugins folder.
3. Rename the foogallery folder to foogallery1 in order to deactivate the plugin.
4. At this point, your site should be working again.
5. Please contact our support and provide the following info:
    * What version of WordPress you are running.
    * What version of PHP you are using.
    * What version of FooGallery you installed.
    * What error was shown when your site was broken?
    * What plugins and theme are you using?

= Do you care about Google's Core Web Vitals? =

A faster gallery now means a more favourable ranking in Google!
FooGallery has been specifically optimized to score better for Google's Core Web Vitals update in 2021.
We have focused on the speed of our javascript code, and also improved the visual stability of all gallery layouts.
This has led to dramatically better scores for the 3 key lighthouse factors including:

*   Largest Contentful Paint - galleries load and appear quicker for your visitors
*   First Input Delay - you can interact with the gallery sooner
*   Cumulative Layout Shift - gallery images shift around a lot less than before!

= I purchased a PRO license, but the Free version is still running. =

Make sure you are running the PRO version. You can check this by visiting the FooGallery -> Account page within the WordPress admin.
If you do not have the PRO version, you can download it by visiting your account page at https://fooplugins.com/account
If you have the PRO version, then clear any caches on your site or for your host. Also clear CSS Optimiztion Cache from FooGallery Settings.
If it still does not work, then please contact our support to help further.

= Why are my thumbnails so blurry? =

Have you enabled retina support for your galleries? To enable retina support, edit the gallery and locate the Retina Support metabox.

= How do I import galleries from another install? =

Simply go to the FooGallery Features page and activate the Import/Export feature on your source installation and your destination installation.
Login into your source WordPress install, and click on the FooGallery -> Import/Export menu item.
Click the Export tab and select the galleries you want to export and click Export.
Copy the export data that is generated.
Login into your destination WordPress install, and click on the FooGallery -> Import/Export menu item.
Paste the export data and click Import.
Please note : the images in your source install need to be accessible to your destination install (this means you cannot lock down your source install if you want this to work).

= How do I get albums working? =

Simply go to the FooGallery Features page and activate the Albums feature.

= Can I add a watermark to my images? =

Yes, our PRO Commerce plan includes image watermarking.

= Can I allow my visitors to comment or like images in a gallery? =

Yes, with the Social Addon [more info](https://fooplugins.com/foogallery-wordpress-gallery-plugin/social/)

= I want visitors to be able to upload their own images to my gallery, including moderation. Do you support this feature? =

Yes, with the User Uploads Addon [more info](https://fooplugins.com/foogallery-wordpress-gallery-plugin/user-uploads/)

= Can I add external links to items in the gallery? =

Yes, you can link to any external website by choosing "Custom URL" for the Thumbnail Link setting. You also then need to set a custom URL for the items in your gallery, which is done by editing the attachment.

= How do I turn off all the PRO Promotions in the admin? =

If you are getting annoyed with our upsell admin messages, and they do not seem to go away, even after dismissing then, then goto FooGallery Settings -> Advanced Tab and check "Disable PRO Promotions" and then save your settings.

= Is FooGallery GDPR Compliant? =

Yes. FooGallery does not collect visitor data, and admin tracking is optional.
