FooGallery is an easy-to-use WordPress gallery plugin, with stunning gallery layouts. It is also responsive, retina-ready and supports lazy loading for lightning fast photo galleries.

Live previews are available while creating a gallery, and also within the Gutenberg block editor with our FooGallery Block. FooGallery was built to be highly configurable and extendable for developers or freelancers.

**Documentation**

**Gutenberg**

We love the new Gutenberg editor. We have built a really simple-to-use Gutenberg block to add your existing FooGallery image galleries in seconds. And it includes live previews of the image gallery too!

**GDPR**

When you install FooGallery for the first time, the plugin asks you (the website admin) to opt-in so that we can track your usage of the plugin and provide a better service (send you update emails for new version releases and security updates etc). *This is optional and not required in order to use the plugin.*

From your website point of view, FooGallery never collects or stores any visitor information at all, when someone visits your website.

**PHP 7 Compatible**

FooGallery has been tried and tested on servers running up to PHP 7.3

**Retina Support**

FooGallery now comes with built-in support for higher quality thumbnails on retina-enabled displays. No more blurry thumbnails, just crisp thumbnails so that your image galleries look amazing on all devices.

**Video Support**

FooGallery PRO now supports the creation of video galleries! Import from YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, TED and Dailymotion, or use a self-hosted video from any online source. You can also easily create mixed galleries with both images and videos!

**Albums Built In**

Albums are built in as an extension. Simply head over to the extensions page and activate the albums extension. A new menu item will appear that allows you to add albums just as easily as galleries.

**Built For Developers**

FooGallery was designed to be the most developer-friendly gallery plugin available for WordPress. It was also built on top of a solid extension framework, which means different functionality is separated out into different areas in the codebase. It also means the core plugin is lightweight, but still allowing for the most flexibility.

**Contribute**

FooGallery is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/fooplugins/foogallery).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `foogallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You will be redirected to the FooGallery Help page to get your started

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My galleries are not working. Thumbnails are greyed out and not loading when I scroll down the page. =

Lazy loading is not working on your gallery. This could be due to a conflict between our plugin and your theme.
You can test this theory by testing a different theme (if possible).
We can help you get it working, by contacting our support.

= I have created a gallery in the backend, but when I look at it on the frontend, it does not show correctly. =

Sometimes, there are issues when the theme does not follow WordPress best practices.
In order for FooGallery to function properly, the theme needs to:
    * A call to wp_head(); in the header.php file.
    * A call to wp_footer(); in the footer.php file.

One way to check if the theme is the problem, is by switching to one of the built-in WordPress themes, and then see if the gallery loads.

= After updating, my galleries no longer work! What should I do? =

Do you have any WordPress caching or optimization plugins? If so, then clear/purge your caches.
Do you have any caching setup at your website host? If so, clear/purge those caches.

= After installing the plugin, my site is broken! Help! =

First thing to do is restore your site to it's previous working state.
1. Get access to your site via FTP, or SFTP.
2. Navigate to the wp-content/plugins folder.
3. Rename the foogallery folder to foogallery1 in order to deactivate the plugin.
4. At this point, your site should be working again.
5. Please contact our support and provide the following info:
    * What version of WordPress you are running.
    * What version of PHP you are using.
    * What version of FooGallery you installed.
    * What error was shown when your site was broken?
    * What plugins and theme are you using?

= I purchased a PRO license, but the Free version is still running. =

Make sure you are running the PRO version. You can check this by visiting the FooGallery -> Account page within the WordPress admin.
If you do not have the PRO version, you can download it by visiting your account page at https://fooplugins.com/account
If you have the PRO version, then clear any caches on your site or for your host. Also clear CSS Optimiztion Cache from FooGallery Settings.
If it still does not work, then please contact our support to help further.

= Why are my thumbnails so blurry? =

Have you enabled retina support for your galleries? To enable retina support, edit the gallery and locate the Retina Support metabox.

= Can I add videos to my galleries? =

Yes, video is supported in FooGallery PRO!

= Do I need to install a separate plugin to show a lightbox? =

For the Free version of FooGallery - Yes, you will need to install FooBox Image Lightbox.
For the PRO version of FooGallery - No, we have built in a uniquely beautiful lightbox!

= How do I get albums working? =

Simply go to the FooGallery extensions page and activate the Albums extension. If you do not see a button to activate the albums extension, reload the extensions list by clicking the reload button.
