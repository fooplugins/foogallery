FooGallery is a responsive WordPress gallery plugin that lets you easily create fast, SEO-friendly image and video galleries with multiple layouts, lazy loading, lightbox support, captions, hover effects, and pagination. The free version includes core templates and customization options, while PRO tiers add advanced layouts (slider, polaroid, grid, etc.), video and mixed media support, dynamic galleries (from folders, Lightroom, posts), filtering and tagging, EXIF metadata, advanced pagination (infinite scroll, load more), ribbons, hover presets, image protection (watermarks, right-click disable), and template blueprints. The PRO Commerce plan further integrates with WooCommerce, allowing product galleries, add-to-cart buttons, variation support, and sales ribbons—making FooGallery suitable for photographers, creatives, and eCommerce stores that want high-performance, customizable galleries.
