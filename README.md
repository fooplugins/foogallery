## Description ##

Foo Gallery allows for better image and video gallery management within WordPress. Built to be simple for users and highly flexible for developers.

[View the Foo Gallery Homepage & DEMO](http://foo.gallery/)

**Video Support**

Foo Gallery now supports the creation of video galleries with the [FooVideo premium extension](http://fooplugins.com/plugins/foovideo/?utm_source=foogalleryplugin&utm_medium=foogallerylink&utm_campaign=foogallery_wprepo)! Create galleries with both images and videos mixed!

**Albums Built In**

Albums are now built in as an extension. Simply head over to the extensions page and activate the albums extension. A new menu item will appear that allows you to add albums just as easily as galleries.
